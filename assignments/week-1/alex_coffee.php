# input validation:
# what makes it valid?
# 1) integer => is_numeric â€” Finds whether a variable is a number or a numeric string. Tip: this will also handle empty
# 2) greater than 0.0 => $input > 0
# 3) not empty => $input != ""
# if input is not valid, let the user know and allow them to try again. we should make this
# a function too...

//if ($input != "" || $input > 0 || is_numeric($input) ) {
//    echo "Error";
//} else {
//    proceed to next step
//}

# Prompting for input in this way will result in a string. We need to cast the input as an integer. If the input is
# non-numeric or a mix of numeric and alphanumeric, the var_dump() will result in a int == 0, which is great!
# There's a bug though, that if the number isn't a whole number (like an integer), it wont work. So let's try floatval()
# instead...
