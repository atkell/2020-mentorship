# Input validation:
# what makes it valid?
# 1) integer => is_numeric â€” Finds whether a variable is a number or a numeric string. Tip: this will also handle empty
# 2) greater than 0.0 => $input > 0
# 3) not empty => $input != ""
# if input is not valid, let the user know and allow them to try again. we should make this
# a function too...

# Prompting for input in this way will result in a string. We need to cast the input as an integer. If the input is
# non-numeric or a mix of numeric and alphanumeric, the var_dump() will result in a int == 0, which is great!
# There's a bug though, that if the number isn't a whole number (like an integer), it wont work.
# So let's try floatval() instead...
